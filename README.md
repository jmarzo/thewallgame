Welcome to another pong game, but this time against the Berlin's wall.
Keep going, don't give up and smash it down hit by hit.
Be careful, every hit makes the ball speed up!

**Instructions**

- Use the trackpad or the mouse to move the racket up and down.
- If you miss the ball you have to start over again, just wait for the trumpet to concloude it's solo.
- Keep going, the wall is not ubreakable but after every hit the ball is going to speed up!
- It's a game developed with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, ensuring compatibility across every browser.
- You don't need to install or download anything, you can play it [here](https://jmarzo.github.io/thewallgame/).

- DOM manipulation and OOP were mandatory requirements.

**JS Structure**

- ball.js contains the core of the program: collisions, speed, directions.
